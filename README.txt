In 2013, while working in India as a U.S. Fulbright Scholar, I collected high-resolution, utility-wise energy consumption data for Delhi -- the world's second largest city, and of course, the capital of India.
 
The cool thing about this dataset, which does not exist publicly anywhere else, is that you can explore how different areas of the city use energy differently. My idea is to overlay district-level demographic data onto the utility-level energy data to explore disparities in energy access as a function of socio-economic status. I hypothesize there will be distinct differences in not only how much electricity is used per capita in high-income vs. low-income neighborhoods, but also differences in the diurnal and seasonal pattern due to varying levels of penetration of energy-intensive appliances such as air conditioning.
